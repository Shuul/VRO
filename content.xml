This is done by changing the parameters of every ship, weapon, missile, engine, shield as well as adding numerous new weapons, missiles and even few ships. The main drive for me to create VRO was that I felt the huge potential in X4 due to how its made, where player can have a real impact on the universe, but some aspects of the game felt very underwhelming to me, specifically how combat felt, and i was struggling from getting the real enjoyment from the game. New and updated weapons, ships, general combat overhaul and &quot;feel&quot; of combat mechanics is the focus of the VRO. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;If you would like to support me, here is my Patreon https://www.patreon.com/shuul" author="Shuul and contributors" version="404" date="2023-07-11" save="1" enabled="1" sync="false" lastupdate="1602802024">

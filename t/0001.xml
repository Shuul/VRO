<t id="1202">Rapier Missile LD</t>
<t id="1203">Fresh from the drawing boards of the Argon Military Research Labs, the Rapier missile can acquire and lock down targets at speed, launching a devastating albeit relatively weak attack against an enemy vessel, far faster than many pilots reflexes. Used in close-range combat, often in numbers, as well as through medium range evasive routines, this device is considered to be an essential backup to any standard array of laser weaponry.
</t>
<t id="1204">Firefly Missile LD</t>
<t id="1205">Firefly Missile LD</t>
<t id="1206">With combat increasingly being fought at ever closer range, Argon Military specialists turned to the development of a more straightforward technology that did not require the advanced guidance systems of other missile units. The result was the Firefly Missile, a small, extremely fast projectile. With a high exit velocity and single trajectory, it is a one shot one chance armament. </t>
<t id="1207">Firelance Missile LD</t>
<t id="1208">Firelance Missile LD</t>

<t id="1221">The Aurora is classed as a Synaptic Detonator missile, a new and revolutionary technology that allows the pilot to choose when to detonate his missile to the split second of pressing the trigger. The pilot first fires his missile and then uses the fire missile trigger again to detonate the missile before the onboard timer expires.
</t>
<t id="1222">Tornado Missile HD SWARM</t>
<t id="1223">Tornado Missile HD SWARM</t>
<t id="1224">The Tornado Missile improves on the one-shot one-chance performance of the Firefly by overpowering the target with a swarm of missiles.

<t id="1231">Wasp Missile LG SWARM LOCK</t>
<t id="1232">Wasp Missile LG SWARM LOCK</t>
<t id="1233">The Wasp Class Missile is a very powerful but still light missile. The Wasp missile is the first choice of small fighter craft. It is fast accurate and very deadly. Its lethal reputation has even led it to be fitted to some destroyers. If fired in masses, the high speed makes it nearly impossible for a weapon system, to defend against all incoming missiles.

<t id="1243">Hurricane Missile MG SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1244">Hurricane Missile MG SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1245">After some concern that this armament would be nothing more than a continuation of the SQUASH Mine's unethical usage, the Hurricane Missile firmly rooted itself in military circles as being the weapon-of-choice when dealing with large numbers of small targets. Perfect for both Kha'ak cluster engagements as well as Pirate raid units.
</t>
<t id="1246">Windstalker Missile MG LOCK</t>
<t id="1247">Windstalker Missile MG LOCK</t>
<t id="1248">One of the most powerful missiles in the synaptic range, the Windstalker has been proven to bring an edge to any combat pilot's weapons portfolio. Good speed and yield make this missile a wise choice for attack runs and interception of mid-range craft. Where covert operations without scanner use are required, the Windstalker is unsurpassed. </t>
<t id="1249">Tempest Missile HG AOE SMART</t>
<t id="1250">Tempest Missile HG AOE SMART</t>
<t id="1251">Dependent on the ship computer of the vessel it was launched on, the Tempest Missile scans for enemy targets and establishes priority of attack. In doing so, if the primary target is lost, it will immediately lock down the secondary, and so on, until it either runs out of fuel, or makes contact. </t>
<t id="1252">Thunderbolt Missile HG HEAT</t>
<t id="1253">Thunderbolt Missile HG HEAT</t>
<t id="1254">The Thunderbolt Heatseeker Missile uses inbuilt guidance systems to lock on to heat signatures on both visible and infra-red spectrums. Doing so allows it to track targets in areas where doing so would otherwise be impossible. Classically used when engaging multiple targets at distance, though pilots have since found other more ingenious uses for them.
</t>
<t id="1255">Hornet Missile HG AOE LOCK</t>
<t id="1256">Hornet Missile HG AOE LOCK</t>
<t id="1257">The Hornet Class Missile is the most powerful weapon known today. The gigantic resources needed to produce this monster also make it extremely expensive. The missile works by setting off a small nuclear charge causing a reaction between three differing elements that are then combined on impact to create a large explosion powerful enough to disrupt even the largest shields. The hornet is, on the other side, the slowest of the known missiles, and is best used against immobile or slow moving targets. </t>
<t id="1258">Hammerhead Missile HG AOE SMART</t>

<t id="1263">The Remote Guided Warhead is designed to be part missile and part drone. It is fired normally however the AI takes over remote control to position the missile into an accurate firing line.
</t>
<t id="1264">Banshee Missile LT LOCK</t>
<t id="1265">Banshee Missile LT LOCK</t>
<t id="1266">A powerful military-grade medium range image-recognition missile, the Banshee offers pilots the chance to show their enemies the true meaning of fear. While not the fastest missile available, its yield and strong acquisition ability allow it to be used in a wide range of combat scenarios against medium to heavy fighters.
</t>
<t id="1267">Typhoon Missile LT SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1268">Typhoon Missile LT SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1269">Holding more accuracy than the Firefly, the Typhoon Missile again allows multiple armaments to be launched at the same target, however with the addition of Image Recognition tracking, the possibility of success has been raised substantially. Again launching simultaneously or in succession, the pilot has the option to fire when not directly pointed at the target at hand.

<t id="1270">Phantom Torpedo MT HEAT</t>
<t id="1271">Phantom Torpedo MT HEAT</t>
<t id="1272">This missile uses an anti-matter warhead similar to that used by the weaponised Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher. It combines this with a proximity fuse and relatively powerful engines to help quickly eliminate any capital ship-sized threats. </t>
<t id="1273">Ibis Torpedo MT LOCK</t>
<t id="1274">Ibis Torpedo MT LOCK</t>
<t id="1275">Ibis is a medium torpedo designed by Teladi company to supply their numerous corvette ships with anti-capital long range firepower.</t>
<t id="1276">Tomahawk Heavy Torpedo HT LOCK</t>
<t id="1277">Tomahawk Heavy Torpedo HT LOCK</t>
<t id="1278">This heavy torpedo was specifically designed for use by the bomber class of ships. The missile is generally fired in salvos by one or more bombers at relatively close range at enemy capital ships.
</t>
<t id="1279">Firestorm Torpedo HT LOCK</t>
<t id="1280">Firestorm Torpedo HT LOCK</t>
<t id="1281">One of the slowest and most powerful projectile weapons in the current batch of armaments used, the Firestorm Torpedo holds devastating destructive force at the expense of speed and manoeuvrability. While remarkably easy to shoot down, if successful, this weapon can yield great damage to a station, and in volume, even destroy it. Its success against large combat craft can be equally devastating when employed on close range attack runs.
</t>
<t id="1282">Spectre Torpedo HT SMART</t>
<t id="1283">Spectre Torpedo HT SMART</t>
<t id="1284">The Spectre is a smart torpedo missile, used by against capital-sized opponents and stations.
</t>
<t id="1285">Flail Barrage Missile CR SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1286">Flail Barrage Missile CR SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1287">Capital ships proved vulnerable to fighter attacks. The Flail missile was therefore designed to counter this, taking advantage of both multiple warheads and advanced target-acquisition technology. Being caught in a Flail barrage is extremely deadly for any nearby enemy fighters.
</t>
<t id="1288">Shadow Missile CR AOE</t>
<t id="1289">Shadow Missile CR AOE</t>
<t id="1290">Cruise missile equivalent of the Hammer Heavy Torpedo, this missile is specifically designed for salvo fire from capital ships against enemy capital ships.</t>
<t id="1291">Wraith Missile CR</t>
<t id="1292">Wraith Missile CR</t>
<t id="1293">Wraith is a fast anti-capital cruise misisle with advanced engine that provides fast acceleration and maneuverability
</t>
<t id="1294">Disruptor Missile LG EMP</t>
<t id="1295">Disruptor Missile LG EMP</t>
<t id="1296">The disruptor missile is an invention of the pirate faction; The Yaki. The missile uses enhanced ion particles to disrupt the electronics and engines of the vessel it hits, leaving the hull and other systems intact.

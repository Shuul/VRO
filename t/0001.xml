<t id="1202">Rapier Missile LD</t>
<t id="1203">Fresh from the drawing boards of the Argon Military Research Labs, the Rapier missile can acquire and lock down targets at speed, launching a devastating albeit relatively weak attack against an enemy vessel, far faster than many pilots reflexes. Used in close-range combat, often in numbers, as well as through medium range evasive routines, this device is considered to be an essential backup to any standard array of laser weaponry.
</t>
<t id="1204">Firefly Missile LD</t>
<t id="1205">Firefly Missile LD</t>
<t id="1206">With combat increasingly being fought at ever closer range, Argon Military specialists turned to the development of a more straightforward technology that did not require the advanced guidance systems of other missile units. The result was the Firefly Missile, a small, extremely fast projectile. With a high exit velocity and single trajectory, it is a one shot one chance armament. </t>
<t id="1207">Firelance Missile LD</t>

<t id="1222">Tornado Missile HD SWARM</t>
<t id="1223">Tornado Missile HD SWARM</t>
<t id="1224">The Tornado Missile improves on the one-shot one-chance performance of the Firefly by overpowering the target with a swarm of missiles.

<t id="1231">Wasp Missile LG SWARM LOCK</t>
<t id="1232">Wasp Missile LG SWARM LOCK</t>
<t id="1233">The Wasp Class Missile is a very powerful but still light missile. The Wasp missile is the first choice of small fighter craft. It is fast accurate and very deadly. Its lethal reputation has even led it to be fitted to some destroyers. If fired in masses, the high speed makes it nearly impossible for a weapon system, to defend against all incoming missiles.

<t id="1244">Hurricane Missile MG SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1245">After some concern that this armament would be nothing more than a continuation of the SQUASH Mine's unethical usage, the Hurricane Missile firmly rooted itself in military circles as being the weapon-of-choice when dealing with large numbers of small targets. Perfect for both Kha'ak cluster engagements as well as Pirate raid units.
</t>
<t id="1246">Windstalker Missile MG LOCK</t>
<t id="1247">Windstalker Missile MG LOCK</t>
<t id="1248">One of the most powerful missiles in the synaptic range, the Windstalker has been proven to bring an edge to any combat pilot's weapons portfolio. Good speed and yield make this missile a wise choice for attack runs and interception of mid-range craft. Where covert operations without scanner use are required, the Windstalker is unsurpassed. </t>
<t id="1249">Tempest Missile HG AOE SMART</t>
<t id="1250">Tempest Missile HG AOE SMART</t>
<t id="1251">Dependent on the ship computer of the vessel it was launched on, the Tempest Missile scans for enemy targets and establishes priority of attack. In doing so, if the primary target is lost, it will immediately lock down the secondary, and so on, until it either runs out of fuel, or makes contact. </t>
<t id="1252">Thunderbolt Missile HG HEAT</t>
<t id="1253">Thunderbolt Missile HG HEAT</t>
<t id="1254">The Thunderbolt Heatseeker Missile uses inbuilt guidance systems to lock on to heat signatures on both visible and infra-red spectrums. Doing so allows it to track targets in areas where doing so would otherwise be impossible. Classically used when engaging multiple targets at distance, though pilots have since found other more ingenious uses for them.
</t>
<t id="1255">Hornet Missile HG AOE LOCK</t>
<t id="1256">Hornet Missile HG AOE LOCK</t>
<t id="1257">The Hornet Class Missile is the most powerful weapon known today. The gigantic resources needed to produce this monster also make it extremely expensive. The missile works by setting off a small nuclear charge causing a reaction between three differing elements that are then combined on impact to create a large explosion powerful enough to disrupt even the largest shields. The hornet is, on the other side, the slowest of the known missiles, and is best used against immobile or slow moving targets. </t>

<t id="1267">Typhoon Missile LT SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1268">Typhoon Missile LT SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1269">Holding more accuracy than the Firefly, the Typhoon Missile again allows multiple armaments to be launched at the same target, however with the addition of Image Recognition tracking, the possibility of success has been raised substantially. Again launching simultaneously or in succession, the pilot has the option to fire when not directly pointed at the target at hand.

<t id="1279">Firestorm Torpedo HT LOCK</t>
<t id="1280">Firestorm Torpedo HT LOCK</t>
<t id="1281">One of the slowest and most powerful projectile weapons in the current batch of armaments used, the Firestorm Torpedo holds devastating destructive force at the expense of speed and manoeuvrability. While remarkably easy to shoot down, if successful, this weapon can yield great damage to a station, and in volume, even destroy it. Its success against large combat craft can be equally devastating when employed on close range attack runs.
</t>
<t id="1282">Spectre Torpedo HT SMART</t>
<t id="1283">Spectre Torpedo HT SMART</t>
<t id="1284">The Spectre is a smart torpedo missile, used by against capital-sized opponents and stations.

<t id="1285">Flail Barrage Missile CR SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1286">Flail Barrage Missile CR SWARM SMART</t>
<t id="1287">Capital ships proved vulnerable to fighter attacks. The Flail missile was therefore designed to counter this, taking advantage of both multiple warheads and advanced target-acquisition technology. Being caught in a Flail barrage is extremely deadly for any nearby enemy fighters.

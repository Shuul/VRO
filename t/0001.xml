<t id="15153">Mjolnir</t>
<t id="15154">When he first proposed the concept of a fusion beam cannon for the Asgard XL Main Battery, Dr Diego Kinjo was told he was insane. Even within the extreme militaristic chambers of the ATF, the idea of a station obliterating "supergun" was considered laughable, largely due to the cost of one prototype being sufficient to build and equip a fleet of destroyers.\n\nKinjo's disappearance was thought to be the end of the matter until, some years later, the prototype and blueprints were delivered to ATF HQ. While it is obvious that a mysterious benefactor took on the responsibility of funding Dr Kinjo's work, to date, no-one has claimed responsibility for this.\n\nNeither has Kinjo been seen again. Speculation persists that his knowledge was just too valuable to fall into the hands of an enemy. It is likely that the visionary engineer was kept confined thereafter, or met with an unfortunate end.</t>

<t id="15164">The Accelerated Graviton Array is simply a medium-sized Graviton Cannon with increased projectile speed through the use of a few in-line accelerators mounted into the weapon. Such a simple, but substantial feat has proved to increase weapon potential substantially in more ways than one.

<t id="15174">Due to the limited effectiveness of the Starburst Shockwave Cannon against enemy corvettes and the high cost of deploying several alternative weapons such as the HEMPC, Terran weaponsmiths designed a new capital-grade weapon based on rapid-fire technology and combined it with the design philosophy of the Barrage Turret. The result was an all-purpose turret that can deal with most S and M-sized targets without sacrificing loss of power against capital targets.</t>

<!-- Chiba carrier -->
<t id="19111">After recent Xenon incursions, Terran High Command saw the need for a fast mobile light carrier. As the need was quite urgent, it was decided to re-use the civilian Hokkaido chassis. While this allowed for new light carrier to be deployed in record time, it suffered from lack of survivability and firepower due to limitations of its chassis. </t>

<t id="1901">The Centaur was developed by Argon Shipwrights in Omicron Lyrae. It is larger than a corvette or medium transporter but is smaller than a destroyer. A frigate-class craft, armed with turrets and strong frontal weapons, the Centaur fills the gap between corvettes and capital ships. While its design is a bit outdated and will be eventually replaced by Cyclops it still goes usual overhauls as one of the most iconic and favorate ship of many Argon captains. </t>
<t id="1902">{20101,12301} {20111,1001}</t>
<t id="19021">This version of Argon freighter was reinforced with additional armor plating and weapon systems in the cost of internal cargo space.</t>

<t id="1903">The Titan was the biggest ship in the Argon fleet before gate shutdown, at present days this model is outdated and maintained only as a symbol of Argons might. It is a battleship armed with numerous turrets and equipped with sufficient hangar for small fighter wing. Although heavy and difficult to manoeuvre, in the hands of a capable Argon Captain, this ship is a powerful weapon with a noble heritage. Its predecessors fought and won many major battles in both the Xenon Conflict and Boron Campaign. </t>

<t id="1904">Shrike is a cheap frigate, basically a refit of commercial vessel to fit the role of light carrier that was needed to patrol outskirts of Teladi space after gate shutdown. These vessels are still used as a support in fleet operations or for patrolling of low-threat territories.</t>

<t id="1905">The Panther is the result of a pre gate shutdown failed bid by the Family Whi Shipyard to win the contract to mass-produce a new frigate class. With some modification to install hangar decks, it was eventually pressed into service as a light carrier instead and is still capable now with some additional weaponry installed in last decade. </t>
<t id="1906">Gharial was developed as an answer to Xenon I after some heavy losses during recent incursions. Raptor was insufficient to withstand direct assault from numerous Xenon capital shi[s and so this heavy battleship is now a primary brawler of Split fleet.</t>

<t id="1909">Hyperion</t>
<t id="19091">This vessel production started form locating of an old prototype floating in Paranid space after the gates shutdown that once was a personal yacht of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia.  At its time this was an astounding ultimate design in Paranid innovation, after spending many years reverse engeneering it finally entered mass production, though still rarely seen due to costs of the hull. </t>

<t id="1910">After Xenon missile destroyer classived as V started to invade Split territory it was apparent that Patriarchy military lacked long-range missile support and so Viper was developed. This ship boasts good mix of direct firepower and uses multi-tube launchers as main weapon for long-range engaegement. With time new missile type was developed specifically for Viper launcher system to combat lighter threats, including Xenon and Argon fighters. </t>

<t id="1911">The Shikoku is a frigate based on old USC designs that never had a chance to go into production before the gate shutdown. As the Terran Conflict unraveled a sudden expansion of Terran space became a distinct possibility. To prepare for this eventuality, the United Space Command began work on designing ships capable of policing newly conquered systems, serving as protection from pirates and hostile skirmishing fleets alike. They would have to be fast enough to chase down any enemy invader and durable enough to engage them on thier own until stronger reinforcements arrive. However, before the first hulls were completed the gate shutdown forced USC to direct it's resources elsewhere. Now that the gate network realigned and a threat of a new conflict is looming, the old designs were updated and scheduled for production. The Miyagi is the lightest of the terran cruisers. It is fast and well shielded. Intended mostly for rapid response to pirate and Khaak raids, it can stand up to lightly armed destroyers but is no match for Xenon capital ships. It sports an expanded S ships storage and a large crew component. Together with it's speed this ship is well suited for retaking larger trade vessels that had been boarded and taken over by pirates. </t>
<t id="1912">The Makhaira is a medium cruiser based on old USC designs that never had a chance to go into production before the gate shutdown. As the Terran Conflict unraveled a sudden expansion of Terran space became a distinct possibility. To prepare for this eventuality, the United Space Command began work on designing ships capable of policing newly conquered systems, serving as protection from pirates and hostile skirmishing fleets alike. They would have to be fast enough to chase down any enemy invader and durable enough to engage them on thier own until stronger reinforcements arrive. However, before the first hulls were completed the gate shutdown forced USC to direct it's resources elsewhere. Now that the gate network realigned and a threat of a new conflict is looming, the old designs were updated and scheduled for production. The Makhaira is the most common of the terran cruisers. It is well shielded and has an impressive array of large turrets. It was designed to hunt down lone enemy destroyers and thier smaller escorts. Makhaira has a large crew component that comes in handy during boarding operations. If the conditions are right this expensive ship can even stand up to a Xenon K. </t>
<t id="1913">The Akita is a heavy cruiser based on old USC designs that never had a chance to go into production before the gate shutdown. As other cruiser models were meant to counter pirate raiders and lone enemy destroyers, this mighty warship was made to handle more serious threats. While the lighter Shikoku and Makhaira were to patrol internal sectors, the Akita was meant to defend the most dangerous border sectors and strategically important areas and stations of the then unravelling Terran Conflict. As the gate shutdown began, the USC had to divert it's resources elsewhere and no heavy cruiser of this type was ever built. Now however, with the gate network realignment, the Terran Protectorate finds itself with a need for a heavy warhip. The Akita is heavily armed and very well shielded. It has a large crew capacity and a decent fighter docking pad. That power comes at a price however, as the heavy cruiser is both very expensive and relatively slow. This ship can easily stop a Xenon K, and with little luck, even a whole Xenon raid. </t>
<t id="1914">The Sapporo is a battlecruiser based on old designs from the Terran-Conflict era. After the recent gate network realignment skirmishes with the Xenon forces revealed the much feared weaknesses of the Asgard. Its lack of mobility often prevents it from bringing its powerful forward artillery to bear on a moving target, rendering the ship nearly useless in actual combat. As more engagements happened, it became increasingly obvious that normally weaker mobile force would be at an advantage against the main Terran Fleet. This has raised concerns among the terran admiralty that requested a more flexible warship to be added to the Terran Protectorate's Fleet. In response, an old USC design was updated and made ready for production. The Kagawa is a mighty warship that pushes the engineering boundaries of what is possible with L-class ship power cores. This battlecruiser has an impressive array of heavy turrets and can have up to six L-class shield generators. Its hull is very durable and it has a large crew capacity. The Sapporo is however very slow and extremely expensive, with a price tag and an operating speed comparable to that of Asgard's. This has led many Terran captains to refer to it as a 'pocket battleship'. At the same time its many turrets can effectively counter any fleet formations that focus on speed rather than raw power. The Sapporo makes for an excellent flagship or a lead vessel of a larger fleet.</t>

<t id="1920">Triton</t>
<t id="1921">As relations between the Protectorate and the Pioneers deteriorate, the Pioneers felt the need for a domestically designed and produced warship. As a result, the Triton was created as a prototype to test design ideas. Although it possesses a considerable amount of firepower for a ship of this size, the hull plating had to be thinned to create space for its power generation systems.</t>

			<t id="1">Commissioned not long after the Jump Gates shut down, the (Akita){20101, 64601}-class of frigates were designed during a period of uncertainty. Due to the restructuring of USC and ATF into the Terran Protectorate and the aftermath of recent war with the Commonwealth, Terran navy logistics were heavily strained with repairing and refitting tasks. The heavily strained logistics combined with the economic shock of losing the Torus Aeternal created a environment where a cheap and long enduring class of vessels were desired in replacing heavier classes of vessels for patrolling the outer rim of Sol. Given the urgency, Terran engineers based most systems of the (Akita){20101, 64601}-class on the mostly finalized Maccana(same as seen in X3AP)-class frigates to reduce cost and design time.\n\nAlthough designed for anti-piracy patrol and freighter escort, for the majority of its service history the (Akita){20101, 64601}-class frigates saw an unexpectedly peaceful Sol. Most of the newly built (Akita){20101, 64601}-classes were soon mothballed and stored in the outer rim stations. Even the ones remained active served more commonly as military transports rather than its orginal roles. As the gates reopened however, (Akita){20101, 64601}-class of ships saw a much heavier usage within both the Pioneer Initiative and Terran Protectorate. The long endurance of the (Akita){20101, 64601}-class made it the perfect frontier vessel for usage in the then empty Segairs systems. The same endurance also made it the perfect escort for Protectorate fleets' expeditions deep into Commonwealth space.</t>

			<t id="2">When the Pioneer Initiative was first established, a number of (Akita){20101, 64601}-class frigates were assigned into the initiative. Although the Pionners were satisfied with the anti-fighter performance of the (Akita){20101, 64601}-class, they soon wanted a class of dedicated anti-capital ships to complement the fleet of (Osaka){20101, 60201}-classes. After a short examination period, a descision was made to refit existing (Akita){20101, 64601}-classes for the role and thus the (Kitsune){20101, 13201} refit program was established. Although the program is still under devolepment and testing, early combat results are promising and plans are already being drawn to produce new (Kitsune){20101, 13201}-class directly.\n\nCompared to the (Akita){20101, 64601}-class, (Kitsune){20101, 13201}-class refits featured a much more distinguished anti-capital ships ability. The refits lost their upper deck turrets in favour of torpedo launchers while its extended fuel and cargo storage were also removed for more ammunition capacity.</t>

			<t id="13324">The "Lacerator" Autocannon utilizes a novel tightly-packed cluster ammunition. While not as effective as other weapons in its class versus capital vessels it excells at quick and efficient removal of smaller threats.
